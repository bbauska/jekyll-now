Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

I'll make some changes.  For instance, this file is/was dated 2004/03/03  titled 2014-3-3-Hello-World.md.

New will be 2020-04-05-page-01.md.
